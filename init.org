* The main file (~init.el~)
All conf code is self-contained in =~/.emacs.d= dir. If no =~/.emacs= file is
found, emacs will use =~/.emacs.d/init.el=. This in turn call other files in a modular fashion.
First, customize built-in features.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")

(load-library "init-startup.el")
(load-library "init-general.el")
(load-library "init-visual.el")
(load-library "init-text.el")
(load-library "init-os.el")
(load-library "init-python.el")
(load-library "init-latex.el")
#+END_SRC

Then add extra packages, either from repositories or from local subfolders.

Make sure you *select just the packages you are interested in*, otherwise be aware that all missing packages on repositories will be downloaded and installed on startup, which requires time + internet bandwidth.

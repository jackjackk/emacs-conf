* My emacs configuration

Cumulated over years, all the elisp configuration lines I found interesting for
my workflow in their tidiest form I could come up with, both for Windows and Linux.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/jackjackk/emacs-conf.git ~/.emacs.d
mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs.bak
#+END_SRC

  via a ~(load-library "init-XXX.el")~.
- Packages defined in ~package-list~ (~init.el~) are automatically installed
  from MELPA if missing,
  and their respective configuration file ~init-mod-XXX.el~ loaded.
- Entries defined in ~other-package-list~ (~init.el~) are the names of subfolders
  to be included in ~load-path~, referring to packages outside the MELPA
  system. Their respective configuration file ~init-mod-XXX.el~ is also loaded.

Uncompress the file ampl-mode.tar.gz in the directory of your choice. It should
contain the files

	ampl-mode.el
	INSTALL

You are currently viewing the file install. To fix the ideas, let us assume
that you uncompressed the archive in the directory /home/yourhome.

Open the file ampl-mode.el in Emacs and say M-x (which means that you keep the
[ALT] key pressed down and press X). Then, in the mini-buffer, type
"byte-compile-file" and press Return. If Emacs asks you for a filename, type
"ampl-mode.el". This should create a file called ampl-mode.elc in the same
directory.

Open your Emacs configuration file. It is usually called .emacs,
.gnu-emacs, .gnu-emacs-custom, or similar, and is usually located in
your home directory. Paste the following at the bottom of the file:

(setq load-path (cons "/home/you" load-path)) ;; Adjust path here
;; Ampl mode
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.mod$" . ampl-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.dat$" . ampl-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.ampl$" . ampl-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq interpreter-mode-alist
      (cons '("ampl" . ampl-mode)
            interpreter-mode-alist))

(autoload 'ampl-mode "ampl-mode" "Ampl editing mode." t)


Now exit Emacs, and restart it. You should have access to syntax highlighting
and basic indentation when opening Ampl models and data files whose name ends
in .mod, .dat or .ampl.

I like my AMPL commands file with the .ampl suffix. If you prefer .run or
anything else, adjust the 4th setq command in the code above.

Enjoy.
